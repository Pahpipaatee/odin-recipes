 <h2>Steps</h2>

 <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>In a bread machine pan, place milk, 2 eggs, butter, sugar, salt, bread flour, and yeast in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Run dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 90 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place dough out on a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle about 16x20 inches.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle 3/4 cup cheese on dough, all the way to the edges. Add pepperoni and jalapeños. Finally, sprinkle with another 3/4 cup cheese.</li>
    <li>With the long side of the dough rectangle facing you, roll dough tightly into a log; slice into 1-inch-thick rounds.</li>
    <li>Place rounds 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Whisk remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush rolls with egg wash. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup cheese on top of rolls.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes.</li>
